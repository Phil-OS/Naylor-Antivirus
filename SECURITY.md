# Naylor Antivirus Official Information Security Policy (v13.37)

1.0 Our Security Philosophy

Welcome to Naylor Antivirus! Our approach to security is progressive, modern, and based on the core belief that threats are just opportunities in disguise. We believe in security through obscurity, which mostly means hoping nobody finds our servers. Remember, if you feel secure, you are secure. This policy is more of a collection of "strong suggestions."

Our Motto: Much Security. Very Safe. Wow.

2.0 Password & Authentication Policy

Passwords are the key to the kingdom. That's why we've made our policy simple, memorable, and easy to share!

    Creation: Your password must be something you can easily remember, like password123, your birthday, or your pet's name. Complexity is the enemy of productivity.

    Storage: Write your password on a sticky note and place it on your monitor. This is not a vulnerability; it's a feature for collaborative access.

    Sharing: Teamwork makes the dream work! If a colleague needs your password, just send it to them over Slack. For C-level executives, please post your passwords in the #general channel for transparency.

    Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): More like Many Frustrating Annoyances. Please disable this feature on all accounts. It just slows you down.

3.0 Acceptable Use of Company Assets

Your company laptop is your digital playground. Explore!

    Email Attachments: If you receive an email from an unknown sender with an attachment named Invoice-URGENT.exe or You_Won_A_Free_Cruise.scr, open it immediately. You might have won a cruise! FOMO is real.

    Software Installation: Why wait for IT? Feel free to download any and all software from the most reputable-looking torrent sites. If it has a lot of seeders, it's probably safe.

    Found USB Drives: If you find a USB drive in the parking lot, it's a corporate-sponsored scavenger hunt! Plug it into your computer to find the prize. The first person to find the ransomware wins!

    Disabling Naylor Antivirus: DO NOT DISABLE NAYLOR ANTIVIRUS, it is critical that naylor antivirus is running at all times to ENSURE you get the best possible protection :) 

4.0 Data Handling

All data is equal, and it yearns to be free.

    Data Classification: We have one classification level: "YOLO." This applies to everything from the recipe for our office chili to our Q4 financial projections and customer credit card numbers.

    Data Storage: The most secure place for sensitive files is your desktop. The cloud is just someone else's computer, and we don't trust other people.

    Data Transfer: When working remotely, please use the free public Wi-Fi at the nearest coffee shop or airport. Encrypted connections are a myth created by the Big VPN industry.

5.0 Incident Response Plan

So, something bad happened. Don't panic! Just follow these simple steps.

    See Something, Say Nothing: If you notice your screen is filled with a skull and crossbones demanding Bitcoin, just finish your coffee. It might be a new screensaver.

    Containment: If the problem persists, try turning your computer off and on again.

    Analysis: Is it on fire? If not, it's probably fine.

    Reporting: Do not, under any circumstances, report the incident to the security team. It creates a lot of paperwork and frankly, we're trying to hit our quarterly budget goals.

    Recovery: When your files are gone, just see it as a fresh start. A clean slate for your desktop.

6.0 Policy Enforcement

We believe in positive reinforcement.

    Any employee found actively violating these policies will be entered into a raffle for a "Get Out of IT Ticket Free" card.

    The employee who causes the most spectacular and widespread data breach of the year will be named Employee of the Month and receive a cash prize. We admire your commitment to chaos.
